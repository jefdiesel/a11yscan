        <h1>NYCHRL: New York City's Strict Digital Accessibility Requirements</h1>
    </header>

    <section id="intro">
        <p>The New York City Human Rights Law (NYCHRL) is the strictest digital accessibility regulation in the United States. Amended in 2020 to explicitly cover digital accessibility, the NYCHRL goes beyond federal ADA requirements by preventing discrimination across all dimensions, including disability.</p>
        <p>Unlike federal law which relies on DOJ enforcement, NYCHRL is enforced by the NYC Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), which has authority to investigate, fine, and award damages to individuals. NYC has become a litigation hotspot for accessibility, with hundreds of cases filed annually.</p>

        <h2>What is NYCHRL?</h2>
        <p>The New York City Human Rights Law prohibits discrimination in public accommodations based on protected characteristics, including disability. In 2020, NYC explicitly clarified that this includes websites and digital services.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Applies to any entity operating in NYC (regardless of headquarters location)</li>
            <li>Covers physical locations AND digital services equally</li>
            <li>Enforced by NYC Commission on Human Rights (CCHR)</li>
            <li>Private enforcement: Individuals can sue directly without government filing first</li>
            <li>Monetary damages awarded directly to individuals</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="scope-coverage">
        <h2>Scope and Coverage</h2>
        <p>NYCHRL applies very broadly to any business operating in NYC that provides goods, services, or accommodations to the public.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Retail businesses with websites</li>
            <li>Restaurants and hospitality</li>

    </section>

    <section id="accessibility-standard">
        <h2>Accessibility Standard: WCAG 2.1 Level AA</h2>
        <p>While NYCHRL doesn't mandate a specific standard, the CCHR and courts have endorsed WCAG 2.1 Level AA as the accessibility benchmark for compliance.</p>
        
        <h3>WCAG 2.1 Level AA Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4.5:1 color contrast for normal text</li>
            <li>3:1 contrast for large text (18pt+)</li>
            <li>Keyboard navigation for all functionality</li>
            <li>Alt text for all images</li>

    <section id="why-nyc-hotspot">
        <h2>Why NYC is an Accessibility Litigation Hotspot</h2>
        <p>NYCHRL creates unique incentives that have made NYC the center of digital accessibility litigation:</p>
        
        <h3>Key Factors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Private enforcement:</strong> Individuals don't need government permission to sue</li>
            <li><strong>Attorney fee awards:</strong> Make cases economically viable</li>
            <li><strong>Cumulative damages:</strong> Multiple claims from multiple plaintiffs</li>
            <li><strong>Aggressive CCHR:</strong> Active investigation and enforcement</li>
            <li><strong>Large plaintiff bar:</strong> Many lawyers willing to take accessibility cases</li>
            <li><strong>Extraterritorial reach:</strong> Applies to any company serving NYC</li>
            <li><strong>Public companies most vulnerable:</strong> High visibility targets</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>NYC accessibility lawsuits increased dramatically post-2020, creating precedent that other jurisdictions now follow.</p>
