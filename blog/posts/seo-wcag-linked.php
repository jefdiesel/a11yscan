    <section id="intro">
        <p>Your marketing team wants better SEO. Your compliance team wants WCAG compliance. You think these are different problems. They're not. They're the same problem with different names.</p>
        <p>Search engines and assistive technologies want the same thing: clear, structured, semantic content. Google's crawlers and screen readers both read the underlying HTML. If it's poorly structured, both fail. If it's well-structured, both win.</p>
        <p>The best part? You don't need to build two different sites. One accessible, semantic site ranks better in search and works better for users. Full stop.</p>

    <section id="semantic-html-foundation">
        <h2>The Foundation: Semantic HTML Is SEO Gold</h2>
        <p>Before we talk about Google, let's talk about what actually matters: semantic HTML.</p>
        <p>Semantic HTML means using HTML tags for their intended purpose. A navigation menu is a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, not a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. A heading is an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, not a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with big CSS. A form label is a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>, not a randomly positioned <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>Why does this matter for SEO?</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google understands structure:</strong> When you use proper HTML tags, Google knows what's a heading, what's a link, what's main content, and what's navigation. This directly impacts ranking.</li>
            <li><strong>Content hierarchy is clear:</strong> An <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is more important than an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, which is more important than an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>. Google uses this hierarchy to understand your page's topics and subtopics.</li>
            <li><strong>Links are linkable:</strong> A real <code>&lt;a href="..."&gt;</code> tag is crawlable and passes link equity. A <code>&lt;div onclick="..."&gt;</code> doesn't. Google can't follow it, and you're essentially hiding your information architecture from the search engine.</li>
            <li><strong>Forms work:</strong> Real <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> elements with proper <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> tags let Google understand what your users can do on your site. JavaScript form simulacra? Google can't interact with them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you build for accessibility (semantic HTML), you're simultaneously optimizing for SEO. These aren't separate efforts—they're the same effort.</p>

    <section id="google-core-web-vitals">
        <h2>Google's Core Web Vitals: Performance, Accessibility, and Ranking</h2>
        <p>Google doesn't hide the connection between accessibility and search ranking. It's built into their ranking algorithm.</p>
        <p><strong>Core Web Vitals</strong> are Google's metrics for user experience. They include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):</strong> How fast does meaningful content appear? Related to accessibility: users on slow connections and assistive technology users benefit from faster pages.</li>
            <li><strong>First Input Delay (FID):</strong> How responsive is your site to interaction? Related to accessibility: keyboard users and users with motor challenges need snappy responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):</strong> Does the page jump around unexpectedly? Related to accessibility: vestibular disorders, cognitive disabilities, and anyone using keyboard navigation all need stable layouts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sites with better Core Web Vitals rank higher. Sites built with accessibility in mind score better on Core Web Vitals. This isn't coincidence—it's causation.</p>
        <p>Accessible sites are typically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simpler:</strong> Less JavaScript bloat, faster load times.</li>
            <li><strong>Better structured:</strong> Semantic HTML is lighter than div soup with CSS-in-JS.</li>
            <li><strong>More responsive:</strong> Keyboard navigation requires snappy interactions. So does Google's FID metric.</li>
            <li><strong>More stable:</strong> Predictable layout prevents surprise shifts that confuse keyboard and screen reader users.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You get SEO benefits just by building accessibly.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="alt-text-images">
        <h2>Alt Text: Accessibility and Image SEO Are Identical</h2>
        <p>Google can't see images. Neither can blind users. So alt text serves both of them.</p>
        <p>Good alt text describes the image for people who can't see it. It should be concise, meaningful, and describe what the image communicates, not just what it shows.</p>
        <p>Poor alt text: "image.png" or "photo of a cat"<br>
        Better alt text: "Tabby cat sitting on a keyboard, blocking the spacebar"</p>
        <p>Why? Because if you're reading the page aloud and you encounter "image.png," you've learned nothing. If you encounter "Tabby cat sitting on a keyboard, blocking the spacebar," you've experienced the same content as a sighted user.</p>
        <p>Google sees that same alt text and indexes it. Images with descriptive alt text rank better in Google Images. You're also providing context that helps Google understand what's happening in the image, which improves the overall page's ranking.</p>
        <p>This is a direct SEO win: write good alt text for accessibility, and your image rankings improve. No additional work required.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="heading-structure">
        <h2>Heading Structure: Navigation for Users and Search Engines</h2>
        <p>A proper heading hierarchy does two things simultaneously:</p>
        <p><strong>For screen reader users:</strong> Headings are landmarks. I can jump from heading to heading and quickly understand what's on the page. If your headings are garbage, I can't navigate at all.</p>
        <p><strong>For Google:</strong> Headings are structure signals. They tell Google what topics are covered, what's most important, and how the page is organized. Good heading structure improves ranking.</p>
        <p>The rules are the same for both audiences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with one <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> per page (your page's main topic).</li>
            <li>Use <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, etc. in order. Don't skip levels (no <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> then <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>).</li>
            <li>Make headings descriptive. "Services" is worse than "Accessibility Audit Services."</li>
            <li>Don't use headings for styling. If you want big text, use CSS on a paragraph. Headings are semantic structures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you optimize your heading structure for screen readers, you're simultaneously optimizing for Google.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="keyboard-navigation-ranking">
        <h2>Keyboard Navigation: User Experience Signals</h2>
        <p>Google can't measure whether your site works on a keyboard. But it measures something related: bounce rate, time on page, and conversion rate.</p>
        <p>If your site doesn't work with a keyboard:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>People trying to navigate with keyboards bounce immediately (high bounce rate).</li>
            <li>People who can't use a mouse spend less time on your site (they get frustrated).</li>
            <li>People can't complete forms or purchases (lower conversion rate).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your site works with a keyboard:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>More people can navigate and interact.</li>
            <li>They spend more time exploring.</li>
            <li>More of them convert.</li>
            <li>Google sees lower bounce rates and higher engagement. You rank better.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is an indirect but measurable SEO benefit. And it directly serves people who use keyboards, people with mobility challenges, and people in temporary situations (broken mouse, one-handed browsing, etc.).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mobile-accessibility">
        <h2>Mobile-First Indexing: Where Accessibility and SEO Collide</h2>
        <p>Google has switched to mobile-first indexing. This means Google crawls the mobile version of your site first and uses that for ranking. If your mobile site is inaccessible, your ranking suffers.</p>
        <p>Mobile accessibility checklist (which is also an SEO checklist):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Touch targets are large enough:</strong> Minimum 44×44 pixels. Good for people with motor challenges. Also good for SEO—Google rewards sites that are easy to tap.</li>
            <li><strong>Text is readable without zooming:</strong> Good for accessibility. Also good for SEO—Google wants sites that don't require zooming.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation works on mobile:</strong> Good for accessibility. Also good for SEO—Google wants mobile users to find what they're looking for.</li>
            <li><strong>Forms are completable on mobile:</strong> Good for accessibility. Also good for conversion rates. Good for SEO—lower bounce rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Content reflows properly:</strong> Good for accessibility. Also good for SEO—no weird horizontal scrolling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mobile-first indexing forces you to build accessibly on mobile. You can't get around it. And when you do, SEO improves as a side effect.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="structured-data">
        <h2>Structured Data: Schema Markup for Users and Search Engines</h2>
        <p>Structured data (schema markup) tells Google what's on your page in a machine-readable format. It also helps screen readers understand your content better.</p>
        <p>Example: You're a business with an address. You can write it in plain text. But if you use schema markup for <code>PostalAddress</code>, Google knows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a real address (appears in Google Maps).</li>
            <li>Your business is more trustworthy (rich snippets in search results).</li>
            <li>Screen reader users know this is a structured address, not just random text.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You're marking up the same content once for both audiences. When you add schema markup:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google indexes your content better and ranks it higher.</li>
            <li>Screen readers can announce "Address: [address]" clearly.</li>
            <li>You get rich snippets in search results (star ratings, prices, availability, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One effort. Two benefits.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="content-clarity">
        <h2>Clear Content: Accessibility and User Engagement</h2>
        <p>WCAG requires clear, simple language. This is also what Google's algorithm rewards.</p>
        <p>Why? Because people understand it better. They stay on your site longer. They share your content. They convert.</p>
        <p>Content that's accessible is content that's:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simple:</strong> Short sentences, common words, clear structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Well-organized:</strong> Information is grouped logically, headings are clear, readers know what to expect.</li>
            <li><strong>Scannable:</strong> Bullet points, short paragraphs, emphasis on key terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Actionable:</strong> Readers know what to do next.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sites with clear content have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lower bounce rates (people understand the content and stay).</li>
            <li>Higher time on page (they're reading, not getting confused).</li>
            <li>Higher conversion rates (clear calls to action).</li>
            <li>Better ranking signals (engagement metrics tell Google this content is valuable).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you optimize for readability and accessibility, you optimize for SEO.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="cost-comparison">
        <h2>The Cost Comparison: Accessible vs. Not Accessible</h2>
        <p>Building one accessible site that ranks well costs less than building an inaccessible site and then trying to fix SEO later.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach 1: Build accessible from the start</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Semantic HTML ✓</li>
            <li>Proper heading structure ✓</li>
            <li>Alt text on images ✓</li>
            <li>Keyboard navigation ✓</li>
            <li>Clear content ✓</li>
            <li>Good SEO ✓ (side effect)</li>
            <li>Lower accessibility litigation risk ✓</li>
            <li>Better conversion ✓</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Approach 2: Build with divs, optimize for SEO later</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript div structures (no semantic meaning)</li>
            <li>Hire SEO consultant to advise on heading structure</li>
            <li>Hire accessibility consultant to fix accessibility violations</li>
            <li>Refactor HTML throughout the site</li>
            <li>Rewrite content for clarity</li>
            <li>Fix keyboard navigation (rebuild interactions)</li>
            <li>Add alt text to every image retroactively</li>
            <li>Still lower conversion rates (people can't easily navigate)</li>
            <li>Still higher accessibility litigation risk (remediation is incomplete)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The second approach costs 3-5x more than the first and never quite catches up. Start accessible. The SEO benefits are automatic.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ranking-factor">
        <h2>Accessibility and User Experience as Ranking Factors</h2>
        <p>Search engines have increasingly aligned their ranking factors with user experience and accessibility. Generally recognized best practices establish that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sites that work well for all users rank better than sites that work only for some users.</li>
            <li>Mobile accessibility directly impacts mobile search rankings.</li>
            <li>Fast, semantic, well-structured sites rank better than slow, div-heavy sites.</li>
            <li>Clear, readable content ranks better than unclear, jargon-heavy content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This alignment isn't coincidental. Search engines want to return sites that serve users well. Accessible sites serve more users better. Therefore, they rank better.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="action-items">
        <h2>Start Today: Quick SEO and Accessibility Wins</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audit your heading structure:</strong> One H1, proper hierarchy, descriptive headings.</li>
            <li><strong>Add alt text to images:</strong> Descriptive, concise, meaningful.</li>
            <li><strong>Test keyboard navigation:</strong> Tab through your site. Does it work?</li>
            <li><strong>Check your color contrast:</strong> WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1). Use a tool like WebAIM.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplify your language:</strong> Read your content aloud. Is it clear?</li>
            <li><strong>Add schema markup:</strong> Tell Google what your content is about.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile-first design:</strong> Test on mobile. Is it usable?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These aren't just accessibility improvements—they're SEO improvements. One effort, multiple benefits.</p>
