        <h2>You've Been Sued. Now What?</h2>
        <p>An accessibility demand letter arrived, or worse, a lawsuit. Now you need to fix your website. But how?</p>
        <p>You have three strategic options: quick fixes (remediation), comprehensive overhaul (retrofit), or complete rebuild. Each has different costs, timelines, and legal implications. Choosing the wrong strategy can cost millions.</p>

        <h2>The Three Strategic Approaches</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Remediation: Quick Fixes (Patch)</h3>
        <p>Fix only the violations found in the lawsuit. Band-aid approach.</p>

        <h3>2. Retrofit: Comprehensive Overhaul (Major Renovation)</h3>
        <p>Audit entire site, fix all accessibility violations systematically, maintain current architecture.</p>

        <h3>3. Rebuild: Start Over (New Foundation)</h3>
        <p>Complete redesign and rebuild with accessibility-first approach from ground up.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="remediation">
        <h2>Option 1: Remediation (Quick Fixes)</h2>

        <h3>What It Is</h3>
        <p>Fix only the specific violations mentioned in the lawsuit or demand letter. Nothing more.</p>

        <h3>Best For</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Small violations (specific pages, specific issues)</li>
            <li>Urgent settlement agreements</li>
            <li>Limited budget and time</li>
            <li>External pressure (lawsuit settlement, government mandate)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1-4 weeks for most violations</li>
            <li>Fastest option</li>
            <li>Can demonstrate good faith quickly</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cost Analysis</h3>
        <pre style="background: var(--bg-secondary); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 4px; overflow-x: auto; font-family: monospace; font-size: 0.9rem;">
Typical Remediation Budget:

Fixed Violations (20-50 issues):
  Development time: 40-80 hours @ $150/hr = $6,000-$12,000
  Testing & QA: 10 hours @ $150/hr = $1,500
  Project management: 5 hours @ $100/hr = $500
  
TOTAL: $8,000-$14,000

Fast-track option (1 week):
  Additional rush fees: +$2,000-$5,000
  
TOTAL RUSH: $10,000-$19,000

One-time investment. No ongoing cost.
        </pre>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fast implementation</li>
            <li>Low cost</li>
            <li>Quick settlement signal</li>
            <li>Minimal disruption to site</li>
            <li>Demonstrates responsiveness</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Doesn't fix unstated violations (you WILL be sued again)</li>
            <li>Piecemeal fixes create technical debt</li>
            <li>Multiple bug fixes needed as overlays fail</li>
            <li>Users with disabilities still encounter barriers</li>
            <li>Doesn't solve underlying architectural issues</li>
            <li>High risk of lawsuits within 12 months</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legal Risk</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>High: Other violations remain unfixed</li>
            <li>Serial litigation: Expect more lawsuits</li>
            <li>Demonstrates inadequate accessibility commitment</li>
            <li>Settlement shows you knew about violations</li>
            <li>Courts may view remediation-only as bad faith</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Real-World Outcome</h3>
        <p><strong>Company fixes 10 violations in demand letter. Sued again 6 months later for 50 different violations on different pages. Total legal and remediation costs: $100,000+</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section id="retrofit">
        <h2>Option 2: Retrofit (Comprehensive Overhaul)</h2>

        <h3>What It Is</h3>
        <p>Conduct a full accessibility audit of entire site. Fix all violations systematically while keeping current architecture and codebase.</p>

        <h3>Best For</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Medium to large sites with systemic violations</li>

        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2-6 months for most websites</li>
            <li>Phased approach (critical → high → medium → low)</li>
            <li>Can parallelize with ongoing business</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cost Analysis</h3>

            <li>May require temporary site limitations during rollout</li>
            <li>Architectural debt may limit fixes on some features</li>

            <li>Documented remediation timeline shows good faith</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Real-World Outcome</h3>

        <h2>Decision Framework: Which Approach?</h2>

        <h3>Remediation When:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Violations are isolated (specific pages, specific issues)</li>
            <li>Settlement agreement is imminent</li>
            <li>Time pressure is extreme (immediate demand response)</li>
            <li>Budget is severely limited ($10k-$20k)</li>
            <li>Site is small (under 25 pages)</li>
            <li><strong>Risk acceptance:</strong> You understand you'll likely be sued again</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Retrofit When:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Violations are systemic but site architecture is sound</li>
            <li>Site is 2-5 years old with reasonable tech stack</li>

        <h3>Rebuild When:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Site is 5+ years old with architectural problems</li>
            <li>Violations are pervasive and deeply rooted</li>

        <pre style="background: var(--bg-secondary); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 4px; overflow-x: auto; font-family: monospace; font-size: 0.9rem;">
Remediation-only:
  Year 1: Initial fix ($15K) + Attorney fees ($5K) = $20K
  Year 2: Second lawsuit settlement ($30K) + Fixes ($20K) = $50K
  Year 3: Third lawsuit ($40K) + Fixes ($25K) = $65K
  3-Year Total: $135K (plus reputation damage)

Retrofit:
  Year 1: Audit + Retrofit ($80K) + Attorney fees ($3K) = $83K
  Year 2: Annual review ($3K) = $3K
  Year 3: Maintenance ($3K) = $3K
  3-Year Total: $89K (plus improved accessibility)

Rebuild:
  Year 1: Rebuild ($300K) + Attorney fees ($2K) = $302K
  Year 2: Maintenance ($2K) = $2K
  Year 3: Maintenance ($2K) = $2K
  3-Year Total: $306K (ELIMINATED accessibility litigation)

ROI Insight: Retrofit often cheaper than serial litigation

    <section id="settlement">
        <h2>Negotiating Settlement with Strategy</h2>

        <h3>What Courts Look For</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Good faith commitment to accessibility</li>
            <li>Realistic remediation timeline</li>
            <li>Professional involvement in fixes</li>
            <li>Documentation and VPAT</li>
            <li>Demonstration of testing</li>
            <li>Prevention plan for future violations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Settlement Language Matters</h3>

        <h3>Weak Settlement (Likely to fail)</h3>
        <pre style="background: var(--bg-secondary); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 4px; overflow-x: auto; font-family: monospace; font-size: 0.9rem;">
"Defendant will fix the violations listed in the 
complaint by [date]."

Result: You fix those specific issues. Plaintiff finds 
100 other violations. You're sued again.
        </pre>

        <h3>Strong Settlement (Protects you)</h3>
        <pre style="background: var(--bg-secondary); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 4px; overflow-x: auto; font-family: monospace; font-size: 0.9rem;">
"Defendant will conduct comprehensive accessibility 
audit (VPAT), fix all WCAG 2.1 Level AA violations 
found, maintain ongoing annual audits, and document 
all efforts. Remediation timeline: [phase 1: critical 
by X date, phase 2: all violations by Y date]. 
Professional auditor involved. Annual conformance 
reports required."

Result: Court recognizes systemic approach. Less likely 
to accept new suits for same issues.

        <h2>Ongoing Maintenance: All Three Require It</h2>

        <h3>Annual Review (Year 2+)</h3>
        <p>Regardless of initial approach, ongoing maintenance prevents regression:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Annual accessibility audit: $3-5K</li>
