        <h1>ADA Title III & Web Accessibility: What You Need to Know</h1>
    </header>

    <section id="intro">
        <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Title III is the primary federal law governing web accessibility for private businesses in the United States. Despite decades of legal debate, courts continue to find that websites are "places of public accommodation" and therefore must comply with accessibility standards.</p>
        <p>This guide explains what ADA Title III requires, the current legal landscape, and practical steps to ensure compliance.</p>

        <h2>What is ADA Title III?</h2>
        <p>ADA Title III prohibits discrimination by private entities in the provision of goods or services. The law applies to any business open to the publicâ€”which courts have increasingly interpreted to include websites and digital services.</p>
        
        <h3>Scope of Coverage</h3>
        <p>Title III covers private businesses but does NOT cover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Federal government agencies (covered by Section 508)</li>
            <li>State and local governments (covered by Title II)</li>
            <li>Private clubs or religious organizations (limited exceptions)</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="wcag-standard">
        <h2>The WCAG 2.1 Level AA Standard</h2>
        <p>While the ADA itself doesn't mandate a specific technical standard, the Department of Justice and most courts recognize WCAG 2.1 Level AA as the appropriate benchmark for web accessibility compliance.</p>
        
        <h3>What WCAG 2.1 Level AA Requires</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4.5:1 color contrast ratio for text</li>
            <li>Keyboard navigation through all content</li>
            <li>Alt text for images</li>
            <li>Captions and transcripts for video</li>
            <li>Proper heading hierarchy</li>
            <li>Screen reader compatibility</li>
            <li>Form labels and error identification</li>
        </ul>
